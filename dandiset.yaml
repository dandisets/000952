description: 'Local field potential (LFP) recordings from 12 male Long-Evans rats
  during a temporal discounting task. LFP was recording using an RHD interface board
  (Intantech) and Open Ephys recording software. Data was recorded at 1Khz, with a
  band-pass filter set at 0.3 to 999 Hz during acquisition. Physiology data was integrated
  with behavioral data using a lab-streaming-layer (LSL) protocol. Recordings are
  taken from 32 different brain areas. Subjects chose between a small (10uL/ 1s) reward
  delivered after a fixed short delay (500ms after response) or a large (30uL/3s)
  reward delivered after a fixed delay that varied from session to session (500ms,
  1, 2, 5, 10, 20s). '
